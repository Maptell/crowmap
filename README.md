"Keep your maps clean"

UMN Mapserver, mapserver as it is widely called, is one of the most powerful opensource mapping servers available. 

Despite it's stark power and the availability of a large number of connectors, the developers using UMN Mapserver are not too many. There are some reasons but the obvious one is the lack of a powerful and convenient editor to edit mapfiles, the configuration file used in mapserver.

Crowmap attempts to solve this disability by providing an easy-to-use, intuitive tool to create mapserver mapfiles.

It keeps your maps in a clean way.
